# Realistic Volumetric Glass Shader (Unity BRP)

## Introduction

A physically-based glass shader designed for the **Unity Built-in Render Pipeline (BRP)** and **VRChat** environments.

This shader applies the **Beer-Lambert Law** to simulate physical light absorption based on the thickness of the glass. This achieves a realistic glass material where thin areas appear transparent, while thicker areas appear denser and darker.

The shader has been verified to work in **Unity 2022.3.22f1, 2022.3.22f2** and **VRChat**.

## Key Features

- Instead of simple texture compositing, it calculates the **distance (thickness)** light travels through the glass to reproduce exponential color absorption based on depth.
- It calculates the refractive index differences based on light wavelength to express prism-like edge details (Chromatic Aberration).
